<h2>About this site</h2>
Think of this site as a digital message in a bottle.  It tracks laminated
cards as they pass from person to person and move from place to place.
Using the site is simple:

<ul>
	<li>Find a card and enter its ID
	<li>Write something about the card, such as where you found it
	<li>See where the card has been and who has had it in the past
	<li>Leave the card where someone else will find it
</ul>

You can also <a href="create.html">create</a> your own cards.
You can use the site anonymously if you want, or you can log
in with your Facebook account, so you can track the cards you've
created and posted about.
